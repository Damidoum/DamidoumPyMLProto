# DamidoumPyMLProto

This project aims to deepen my understanding of computational graphs, topological sorting, and the use of primitives in machine learning frameworks.

It complements my first project, DamidoumML, which I am currently developing in my free time. DamidoumPyMLProto serves as a prototype for DamidoumML, allowing me to experiment and progress more quickly by using Python. I will not attempt to develop a new tensor structure from scratch but will instead wrap the Numpy `ndarray` class.
